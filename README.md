# Plagiarism-Detector
This project is a machine learning-based plagiarism detection system that classifies text as original or plagiarized. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, etc.)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model training with multiple classifiers
- Evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report
- Saving and loading trained models for reuse

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled text samples with binary classification: **original** or **plagiarized**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `plag.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure the dataset path is correct in the notebook.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
5. Use the saved SVM model and vectorizer for deployment.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add a Flask web interface for user input
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Expand the dataset for better accuracy
